# Weather Classification with TensorFlow

This project demonstrates a weather classification model using TensorFlow, applied to four different datasets: ACDC, MWD, UAVid, and Syndrone. The notebook provides a step-by-step approach to build, train, and evaluate a machine learning model to classify weather conditions using these datasets.

## Features

- Data preprocessing and augmentation for various weather datasets
- Neural network model development using TensorFlow
- Model training and evaluation across different datasets
- Comparison of model performance using loss graphs, accuracy graphs, and confusion matrices

## Datasets

1. **ACDC**
2. **MWD**
3. **UAVid**
4. **Syndrone**

The project involves comparing the performance of the model across these datasets using different metrics:

- **Loss Graphs**: Shows the training and validation loss for each dataset.
- **Accuracy Graphs**: Displays the training and validation accuracy for each dataset.
- **Confusion Matrices**: Visualizes the modelâ€™s classification performance and confusion between classes for each dataset.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/PooyaNasiri/weather-classification.git

## Results
Visualizations and evaluation metrics like confusion matrices are provided in the notebook.
